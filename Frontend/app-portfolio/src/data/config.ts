        description: `As a current software engineering student at RMIT, I am excited to combine my previous IT degree and passion for programming to pursue a career in web development or backend engineering. With experience in languages such as Python, C++, and Java, I have a strong foundation in programming and a proven ability to deliver high-quality projects.
        
        \nI am particularly interested in backend development and have experience working with REST APIs. In my university projects and personal projects, I have demonstrated my ability to design and implement efficient and scalable solutions, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer.
        
        \nIn the future, I hope to work with a team of talented engineers to create innovative and impactful software solutions. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to challenging projects and continue to develop my expertise in web development and backend engineering.`,
